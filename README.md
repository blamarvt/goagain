Less Opinionated Zero-downtime restarts in Go
---------------------------------------------

The oringal `goagain` package provided primitives for bringing zero-downtime restarts to Go applications. At the time of writing this, however, it has several outstanding bug fixes and PRs. Not only that but the API provided for doing restarts is a bit too opnionated for my taste so I stripped out a lot of logic (and features!) to better suit my use case.

I'm on a deadline so documentation will end here currently. Please feel free to look at the example.
